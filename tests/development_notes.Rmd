# Development of functions for data access

Need functions to extract data for Julia, Liza, Nina

Goal is to create specific alignment tables. A generalized formula can be created after experience has been obtained.

```{r}
index <- "g2_nts_expn"
config_path <- "~/projects/config.yml"
ec <- config::get("elastic_connect", file = config_path)
escon <- elastic::connect(host = '10.140.73.204', user=ec$user, pwd=ec$pwd)
```
